# Best Practices for API Designing

API designing is a crucial aspect of developing efficient and user-friendly applications. Combining the insights from your input and additional considerations, here are best practices to ensure your APIs are well-designed and meet the needs of both developers and clients:

## 1. Naming

**Best Practice:**
Choose meaningful and intuitive names for your API endpoints based on their functionality. Names should accurately represent the action or operation being performed.

**Example:**
```java
// Bad naming
public List<Admin> getGroupInfo(String groupId);

// Good naming
public List<Admin> getAdminsByGroup(String groupId);
```

## 2. Parameters

**Best Practice:**
Define parameters based on the specific action the API performs. Avoid unnecessary parameters and only include those essential for the operation. Consider the context and use case when determining the need for additional parameters.Remember, naming is important, but more than anything, the action you are performing should define the name and parameters.

**Additional Point:**
Additional parameters are considered acceptable, especially in microservices architecture, to optimize queries and avoid additional API calls.

**Example:**
```java
// Avoid unnecessary parameters
public List<Admin> getAdmins(String groupId, List<String> userIds){
//  caller want to get list of admins so here passing list of userIds is unecessary
}

// Better naming and context-specific parameters
public boolean checkAdmins(String groupId, List<String> adminUserIds){
// caller want to check if adminlist he have is same as server have 
}
```

## 3. Response

**Best Practice:**
Return only necessary data in the API response. Avoid returning excessive information that the client does not require. Keep the response size optimized for improved performance.

**Additional Point:**
Returning more detailed information just to make it extensible and to avoid future changes requested by the client is a bad idea.

**Example:**
```java
// Avoid overloading responses
public Response getUserData(String userId){
// returning every available information
}

// Better returning responses
public Response getUserData(String userId){
// returning only username and email
}

```

## 4. Error Handling

**Best Practice:**
Define meaningful error messages that provide relevant information to the client. Avoid generic error messages and take responsibility for specific errors that may occur. Consider common expectations and align error messages with the responsibilities of the API.

**Additional Point:**
Avoid providing detailed error messages for every basic thing, as it may lead to unnecessary information overload.

**Example:**
```java
// Good error handling
public ApiResponse getUserById(String userId) throws UserNotFoundException;

// Bad error handling
public ApiResponse getUserById(String userId) throws Exception;
```

## 5. HTTP Endpoints

**Best Practice:**
Design your API endpoints adhering to the principles of RESTful architecture. Use appropriate HTTP methods for different operations. Separate the routing logic from the actions performed by the API.

**Example:**
```java
// Incorrect mixing of routing and action
@RequestMapping("/v1/getFunction")
public ApiResponse getFunction(@RequestBody RequestObject requestObject);

// Correct separation of routing and action
@RequestMapping("/v1/functions")
public ApiResponse getFunction(@RequestBody RequestObject requestObject);
```

## 6. Side Effects

**Best Practice:**
Avoid APIs with side effects that perform multiple operations. Each API should have a singular purpose, performing only the action specified in its name. Breaking down complex actions into multiple APIs improves clarity and maintainability.

**Additional Point:**
Consider atomicity in your API design. Performing multiple actions within a single API without clear atomicity can lead to confusion and testing difficulties.

**Example:**
```java
// API with unintended side effects
public void setAdmins(List<Admin> admins, String groupId);

// Separate APIs to avoid side effects
public void addMembers(List<Member> members, String groupId);
public void setAdmins(List<Admin> admins, String groupId);
```

## 7. Pagination

**Best Practice:**
Implement pagination for large responses to improve performance and reduce the response size. Break the response into manageable chunks or provide pagination parameters to allow clients to fetch data in smaller portions.

**Example:**
```java
// Pagination through client responsibility
public List<Member> getMembersByGroup(String groupId, int page, int pageSize);

// Pagination through API fragmentation
public List<Member> getMembersByGroup(String groupId, int fragmentNumber, int fragmentSize);
```

## 8. Consistency

**Best Practice:**
Consider the level of consistency required for your data. Perfect consistency can be expensive and slow, so evaluate if it is necessary for your use case. Explore caching options to serve some requests from the cache and reduce the load on the database.

**Example:**
```java
// Balancing consistency and performance
public List<Admin> getAdmins(String groupId, boolean useCache);
```

Adhering to these best practices will contribute to the clarity, maintainability, and efficiency of your APIs. Always keep in mind the balance between simplicity and functionality when designing APIs for your applications.
